# Designing a Tetris game using the C++ programming language

This project aims to learn how to use the SFML library and how to create interfaces for 2D games using the c++ programming language. The game has been developed to a large extent, you can notice the ease in moving the stones and the disappearance of filled lines immediately, you can also notice the points that have been collected, which are printed on the console screen.

The game is designed smoothly so that you can adjust the settings from the temeller.h file in terms of window length and width, number of squares per row and column, number of colors, game speed, and many more.
